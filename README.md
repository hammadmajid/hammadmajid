## Hello there!

I'm **Hammad Majid** a front-end developer with a passion for writing web applications using technologies like Astro and Svelte. I also like to experiment with low-level programming languages such as assembly, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. It's a challenging but rewarding pursuit that keeps me engaged and motivated.

If you appreciate my work and want to support it, please check out my [Patreon page](https://patreon.com/hammadmajid) for more information.
